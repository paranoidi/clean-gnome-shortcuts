# clean-gnome-shortcuts

I got frustrated hunting and removing shortcuts from gnome / cinnamon when working with IDE ...

Clear all offending keyboard shortcuts. This will leave all super-key related bindings
and basic window shortcuts (ALT-Tab, Shift-ALT-Tab, ALT-F4, Alt Space).

Requires Python 3.7+
